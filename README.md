# A simulator for `.cv` files exported from [CircuitVerse](https://circuitverse.org/)

This library can be used to simulate digital logic circuits built in [CircuitVerse](https://circuitverse.org/).

This is not meant as a serious project, so documentation is minimal. If you want an example of how to use it, refer to `tests/test_endtoend.py`.
